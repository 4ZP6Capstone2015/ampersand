Railroad diagrams of syntax
===========================

In the underlying folders you can find .ebnf files of specific versions of Ampersand. These files can be used to [generate Railroad diagrams at the site of Gunther Rademacher] (http://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui)

Unfortunately there is currently no way to automatically keep the .ebnf files in sync with the Ampersand parser sourcecode. Therefor, the actual syntax may differ from what is mentioned in the .ebnf files.
