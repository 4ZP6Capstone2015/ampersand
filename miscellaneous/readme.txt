Ampersand.jgcscs is a file that EditPad Pro can use for colouring ADL sources; it also contains some colouring patterns for colouring syntax errors, but that's not perfect.
Ampersandtest.jgcscs is a similar file, but with experimental colouring stuff. Don't expect it to work, it's here just for backup purposes...

GPP2 contains the (open source) for a General purpose PreProcessor, as well as an executable (GPP2.exe - compiled for use on windows)

mcpp is a C preprocessor, that also works for Ampersand, provided you do not use 'loose' quotes.
