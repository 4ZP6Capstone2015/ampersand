Ampersand.jgcscs is a file that EditPad Pro can use for colouring ADL sources; it also contains some colouring patterns for colouring syntax errors, but that's not perfect.
Ampersandtest.jgcscs is a similar file, but with experimental colouring stuff. Don't expect it to work, it's here just for backup purposes...
