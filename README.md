## Documentation

The best place to look at if you are new to Ampersand, and you want to install the software, is at our [documentation](http://ampersandtarski.gitbooks.io/documentation/). Beware however, it is currently in a VERY preliminary state. We are working on it, but because of limited time and resources, progress is slow. 

There is an [old wiki](wiki.tarski.nl) too, where information can be found. 

There is also some [documentation for the developers of ampersand](http://ampersandtarski.gitbooks.io/the-tools-we-use-for-ampersand/).
