Please include error message. 
I Suppose this has to do with comparing the name of the ConceptDef with the name of the EXPLAIN.

Issue: there are textual symbols that cannot be doublequoted.

One example of this is:

EXPLAIN CONCEPT "Policy" IN ENGLISH {+explanatory text.-}

which leads to a compiler error. However, the syntax

EXPLAIN CONCEPT Policy IN ENGLISH {+explanatory text.-}

poses no problems.
