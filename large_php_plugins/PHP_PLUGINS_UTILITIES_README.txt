--[Introduction]--
Ampersand prototypes are capable of executing 'plugins', i.e. (small) pieces of code that are called whenever a specific VIOLATION is signaled. A commonly used one allows you to populating or depopulating a pair of atoms in a specified relation. Others allow you to send an Email or SMS from a prototype or to compute a transitive closure.

--[Plugin source code and installation]--
Sources for small plugins are located in the directory '<OUrepository>\trunk\static\php\plugins\'.
The plugins in this directory are automatically made available when you generate a prototype (as all 'static' files are).
To include a small plugin that is newer than prototype.exe, prototype.exe should be recompiled.
Alternatively, you can manually overwrite the plugin code that is generated by prototype.exe with the stuff located in the OUrepository. 

Sources for large plugins are located in the directory '<OUrepository>\trunk\large_php_plugins' and must be installed by hand.
An example is the plugin that allows you to read EXCEL files in a prototype. 
The README file in the directory containing a large plugin should document the way in which it is to be installed. 

--[Plugin use]--
There should either be a README file that documents its use (primarily used for large plugins),
or the plugin source code itself should document its use (primarily used with small plugins).
